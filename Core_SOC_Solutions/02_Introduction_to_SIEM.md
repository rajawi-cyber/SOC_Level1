# Introduction to SIEM

**Goal / Objective:**
Understand the fundamentals of **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** and how it supports SOC operations by collecting, normalizing, correlating, and analyzing security events to enable timely threat detection and response.

---

## Key Terms / Concepts

* **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** A centralized security platform used to collect, analyze, and correlate logs from multiple sources.
* **Logs:** Time-stamped records of events generated by systems, applications, and security devices.
* **Log Sources:** Systems that generate logs such as firewalls, endpoints, servers, IDS/IPS, and applications.
* **Normalization:** The process of converting logs from different formats into a consistent structure.
* **Correlation:** Linking related events across multiple log sources to identify suspicious patterns.
* **Detection Rules:** Logical conditions (If/Then) used to trigger alerts based on specific behaviors or thresholds.
* **Alerting:** Notifications generated when detection rules are met.
* **Dashboards:** Visual summaries that provide real-time insights into security events and alerts.
* **True Positive / False Positive:** Classification of alerts based on whether they represent real threats or benign activity.

## How SIEM Works (High-Level Flow)

1. Logs are generated by various systems and devices.
2. SIEM ingests and normalizes these logs.
3. Detection rules correlate events using field-value pairs.
4. Alerts are triggered when suspicious conditions are met.
5. SOC analysts investigate alerts and take action.

---

## Practical Steps / Exercises

* Review logs from multiple sources (firewalls, endpoints, servers).
* Identify key fields such as Event ID, source IP, destination IP, user, and process name.
* Correlate events across different log sources to detect potential incidents.
* Configure basic SIEM detection rules (e.g., multiple failed logins, suspicious process execution).
* Analyze triggered alerts and prioritize them based on severity and impact.
* Classify alerts as true or false positives.
* Document investigation findings and response actions.

---

## SOC Analyst Perspective

* Monitor SIEM dashboards continuously.
* Investigate alerts by reviewing correlated events and rule conditions.
* Tune detection rules to reduce false positives.
* Escalate confirmed threats and coordinate response actions such as isolating hosts or blocking IPs.

## Screenshots / Evidence (Optional)

* SIEM dashboard displaying active alerts.
* Example of a correlated security event.
* Alert investigation view with event details.
* Response action.

## Lab Scenario: Suspicious Activity Alert Investigation

**Scenario Overview:**
During SIEM monitoring, a suspicious activity was manually triggered within the lab environment. The SIEM detected the activity based on an existing detection rule and generated an alert for analyst review.

**Investigation Steps:**

1. Clicked on **Start Suspicious Activity**, which triggered a SIEM alert.
2. Navigated to the **Alerts/Dashboard** view to identify the triggered alert.
3. Opened the alert to review correlated events.
4. Identified the suspicious **process name**, **executing user**, and **hostname** from event details.
5. Reviewed the detection rule logic to determine which term matched and caused the alert.
6. Assessed the activity and classified the alert as a **True Positive**.
7. Selected the appropriate response action, which revealed the lab **FLAG**.

**Outcome:**
The alert represented a genuine suspicious activity. The investigation confirmed that the detection rule worked as intended and demonstrated proper SIEM alert triage and decision-making from a SOC Level 1 perspective.

## Tips / Notes

SIEM is a **detection and visibility tool**, not a prevention tool. Its effectiveness depends heavily on proper log ingestion, normalization, well-designed detection rules, and continuous tuning. A well-configured SIEM enables SOC analysts to quickly identify threats, reduce response time, and improve overall security posture.
