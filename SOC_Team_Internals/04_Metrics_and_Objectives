# SOC Metrics and Objectives

**Goal / Objective:**  
Track and analyze SOC performance metrics to ensure effective alert triage and incident handling.

**Key Terms / Concepts:**  
MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge): Average time taken to acknowledge alerts.
MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve): Average time to resolve incidents.
Alerts Count: Total number of alerts handled per shift.
False Positive Rate (FPR): Percentage of alerts incorrectly flagged.
Alert Escalation Rate (AER): Percentage of alerts escalated to higher SOC levels.
Threat Detection Rate (TDR): Effectiveness in detecting real threats.
Service Level Agreement (SLA): Agreed timeframe for incident response.

Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**Practical Steps / Exercises:**  
- Track MTTA and MTTR for handled alerts  
- Calculate false positive rate from recent alerts  
- Analyze escalation trends to improve triage rules  
- Use metrics to identify areas for process improvement  
- Report metrics to SOC manager regularly  


**Tips / Notes:**  
Monitoring metrics improves SOC efficiency and alert accuracy.
Consistent reporting helps management track analyst performance.
Accurate data collection highlights areas for further training and skill improvement.
