# SOC Workbooks and Lookups

## Goal / Objective
Learn how SOC analysts use workbooks, lookup tables, and threat intelligence to efficiently investigate and triage security alerts.

---

## Key Terms / Concepts
- **Workbook:** Predefined dashboards and queries used to analyze alerts and logs quickly  
- **Lookup Table:** Reference tables used to identify known malicious IPs, domains, or hashes  
- **Threat Intelligence:** External data sources used to enrich alerts and provide context  

---

## Practical Steps / Exercises
- Opened SOC workbooks related to different alert types  
- Analyzed alerts using predefined queries and visualizations  
- Used lookup tables to validate suspicious IP addresses and domains  
- Cross-referenced indicators with threat intelligence sources  
- Monitored medium-risk indicators and escalated confirmed malicious activity  
- Automated repetitive queries to improve investigation efficiency  

---

## Investigation Outcome
- Identified suspicious and malicious IP addresses  
- Successfully extracted investigation flags during hands-on lab exercises  
- Applied proper triage decisions (Monitor vs Escalate)  
- Escalated confirmed malicious indicators to the SOC Team Leader  

---

## Screenshots / Evidence (Optional)
- Alert showing malicious IP activity  
- Validation of IP reputation using lookup tables  
- Escalation ticket created for confirmed malicious activity  
- Firewall rule blocking the malicious IP  

---

## Tips / Notes
- Accurate lookup tables significantly reduce alert triage time  
- Threat intelligence should be continuously updated  
- All changes to lookup tables must be documented for auditing and traceability
