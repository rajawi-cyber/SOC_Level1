# Systems as Attack Vectors

**Goal / Objective:**  

Threat actors can attack insecure systems directly, without the users’ knowledge. These attacks often exploit technical weaknesses rather than human interaction.

**Key Terms / Concepts:**  

	•	System: A physical server, virtual machine, or cloud platform such as Microsoft 365
	•	Attacker Motivation: Stealing data, deploying ransomware, or destroying information with no possibility of recovery
	•	Vulnerabilities: Security flaws that can be exploited to compromise a system
	•	Supply Chain Attack: Malware introduced through a trusted application, update, or software library
	•	Zero-Day Attack: An attack that exploits a vulnerability before it is publicly known or patched
	•	CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures): A standardized identifier used to track known security vulnerabilities
	•	Misconfigurations: Insecure or incorrect system settings that expose systems to attacks
	•	Vulnerability Scans: Periodic automated scans to detect issues such as default passwords or outdated software
	•	Configuration Audits: Manual reviews to ensure systems follow security best practices (e.g., CIS benchmarks)




**Tips / Notes:**  

	•	Systems can be compromised without any user interaction
	•	Poorly configured or unpatched systems are common attack targets
	•	Supply chain attacks may occur when trusted software behaves maliciously after an update
